# CSS Assignment

This repo is created for the purpose of practicing Flex and Grid system. Only pure CSS was used.

## Tasks have been done

1. Complete the styles.css files in each folder to produce the expect result
2. There is one expected.png file in each folder, which shows the expected layout. Colors and spacing can be different, but layout is supposed to be similar.
3. All the changes made to file .css only, I did not modify index.html.
